    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the application of Evidential Learning on an analog to Winstershall's Concession C97-I, which is located in the N-97 field in the Western Hameimat Trough of the Sirte basin of north-central Libya. The reservoir is thus comprised of 5 distinct compartments resulting in 4 uncertain fault transmissibilities. A large aquifer is located in the lowest compartment, but the depth of this oil water contact also remains uncertain. Other uncertain reservoir parameters are relative permeabilites for the oil and water phases and oil viscosity."

    "We consider the situation where 5 producers and 3 injectors have already been drilled at the locations depicted in Figure 5. The field has been in production for 3500 days, and production data is available for all 5 wells. A decision needs to be made regarding the economic feasibility drilling of a 6th producer in the smallest reservoir compartment (denoted PNEW in Figure 5). Specifically, this decision will be made based on the forecasted performance of this new well over the next 4000 days. Therefore, we will seek to estimate the P10-P50-P90 forecasts of PNEW based on the first 10 years of production data from the existing 5 producers."

    "# Loading Prior Model Response Data\n",
    "A prior set of models is required for CFCA to establish a statistical relationship between the data and forecast. In this case, a set of 500 prior models are generated by applying Monte Carlo. The prior models were forward modelled using a streamline simulator (3DSL) over all 7500 days, to encompass both the 3500 days of production data denoted by d, as well as the 4000 days of forecast h required to make the decision regarding the new well."
